        <p>People</p>
        <p>Society. Society in WB is just nuts specially in our neighborhood. We can’t even say when people change, it depends on the individual, weather to be disrespectful or be an honorable person. Why did I write about Kolkata’s society? It’s because there was an awful situation where I had to go through. False allegations.</p>
<p>In our neighborhood an elder sister whom I knew ran with a man which I didn’t know, one of my close friend said that someone was spreading an unusual rumor about me. A rumor which I myself didn’t know, the rumor about me was so fearsome that everyone in the neighborhood started talking about it. The rumor was “Rohit did girl trafficking, It’s because of him my girl went missing.”. At first glance they thought about me, but why did they think about me at first? I’m just a simple kid who likes to socialize with people. Later, my friend told me that they married and came to the house the girl was staying because she was ill. “They accepted their marriage?????” That was the first thing I thought. If everything was good, why ruin my image? They won’t even tell the neighborhood now that she has came as she was married to a dude whom they didn’t even liked at first.

        <h1>Ep.3 ><br><span>Ep.2</span></h1>
        <p>Garbage</p>
        <p>Garbage. Trash. People talked like trash to me, People make me inferior to those who think are superior. I like talking to people, but many people ruin many friendships of mine.</p>
        <p>(1st scenario) If someone asks for a advice and talks says “Bro do u think you’re savage and roasting? Abe tere pas to bestie bhi nhi bhosdike to kya karega. Koi tereko jhelne ke liye hi taiyar nahi hai aisa banda hai tu. Sobai amr bestie howar jonno pagol because they are attracted by me lol. Tera baat to koi sunte bhi nhi hai isliye logo ko kya thora sa kuch boldiya nijeke anek boro nekachoda bhabis. Amake chinis tui lol. I could destroy you in seconds.” She knows nothing about me, I have got 2 best bros in the entire universe and that’s enough friends for me. I don’t want to people to get attracted towards me I only need some good classmates. </p>
        <p>(2nd scenario) Girls who need personal help like stalking someone, disturbing someone 24X7 hours for nothing but just pain. I did help a girl but then at last I realized that it was for bad intend. I literally stalked 10 to 12 people for just one thrash. I had to stalk some of my best friend’s friends to gather information. Stalked some of my senior classmates and also made some enemies during this period. If any of my respected senior classmates are reading this forgive me for what I did to you or how I behaved.</p>
